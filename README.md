# associate-product-eng-travelopia

A simple React application that provides a flight board and flight details page. The app fetches flight data from an API and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

# Features

Flight Board Page: Displays a list of available flights with status, departure, and destination information.
Flight Details Page: Shows detailed information about a specific flight when a user clicks on a flight from the board.
Real-time Data: Flight data is fetched from an API and rendered dynamically.
Error Handling: The app gracefully handles API errors (e.g., no data, failed network requests).
